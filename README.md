# Navbar
 A navbar or rather, a header I made for a project I iceboxed a while back. When my current project ends I will upload the new version of that project and take down this navbar.

the navbar uses Bootstrap 4.6.2, I chose this version for browser compability
 
icons have been taken from google's https://fonts.google.com/icons. downloaded individually to increase load times
