# Navbar
 A navbar I coded for a current project

 calling it a header might be more accurate, this is a project I am uploading mostly to keep my github from being entirely empty while I am working on this project. Any trace of the commpany this project is being done for has been changed with placeholder test images and text has been adjusted as such as well.

the navbar uses Bootstrap 4.6.2, I chose this version for browser compability, the company I working on this project for is in an industry where they have mass appeal, as such I prefered not to restrict their reach by using bootstrap 5.
